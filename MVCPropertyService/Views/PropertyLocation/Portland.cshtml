(The conference website says that all manuscripts are “reviewed for merits and contents.) The authors of the paper, entitled ‘TIC: a methodology for the construction of e-commerce, write in the abstract that they “concentrate our efforts on disproving that spreadsheets can be made knowledge-based, empathic, and compact.";

  ViewBag.SecondParagraph = " Nature News has attempted to contact the conference organizers and named authors of the paper but received no reply; however at least some of the names belong to real people. The IEEE has now removed the paper).  Update: One of the named authors replied to Nature News on 25 February. He said that he first learned of the article when conference organizers notified his university in December 2013; and that he does not know why he was a listed co-author on the paper. The matter is being looked into by the related investigators, he said.";
